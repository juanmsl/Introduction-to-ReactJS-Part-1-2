# Introduction to ReactJS - Part 1/2

## Getting Started

If you want to start learning [React](https://es.reactjs.org/), you can do it in an easy way, there are so many documentation, guides and examples that you can use to understand how React works.

First of all I think it's important to clarify that ReactJS is not a Framework as [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), so ReactJS is a library developed by Facebook since march of 2013:

{% endhint %}

To getting started with React we are going to use the documentation of [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to create, get up and run a new project with ReactJS.

> I suggest to create a repository on [Github](https://github.com/) on any service that allows you versioning your code.

Either [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) can be used as a package manager to manage dependencies in React and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

I rather Yarn instead of NPM, so I gonna use Yarn for this guide

> If you want to use Yarn, but you have only used NPM, heres a [quick guide to migrate from NPM to Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/)
